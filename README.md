# Assignment 2.2 – LTspice DC Sweep (Diode I–V)

## Circuit description
The circuit consists of a DC voltage source (V1), a 1 kΩ resistor (R1), and a diode (D1) connected in series to ground.

## DC Sweep settings
- Source swept: V1  
- Sweep range: 0 V to 1 V  (0v to 5v)
- Step size: 0.01 V  

## What the plot shows
The plot shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristic of the diode, where the diode current remains very small at low voltages and increases rapidly once the diode starts to conduct.
